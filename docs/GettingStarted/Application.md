:::info Discord Docs
Discord has [its own documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro), we recommend reading it together with the Lumi documentation for a better understanding.
:::

### Create an App

- Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click "New Application".
- Enter your BOT name and press "Create".

On the General Overview page, you can update your app's basic information like its description and icon.

### Configure the Bot User

- On the left sidebar, click "Bot";
- Configure settings like privileged intents and installation permissions;
- In the Token section, you can copy and reset your bot's token;
- Now, with a working token, you can go to the next tutorial.

:::caution Tokens
Bot tokens are highly sensitive. Never share your token or check it into version control. Store it safely (e.g., in a password manager).
